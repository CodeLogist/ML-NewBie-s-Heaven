## Welcome to the Machine Learning Noob's Heaven

The repository contains some of many projects which I had done while I was a kid in Machine Learning. Currently the python notebooks are oriented more towards Deep Learning focussing on some old school DL projects which I found very interesting. For few on them it was tough for me to understand there working and to run them in Google Colab, so I wrote the notebooks trainable in Google Colab to help others.

### 1. CNN

The folder contains Python project Notebook using Convolutional Neural Networks for different purposes. Currently it has following:

*Autoencoder
*Image Classification
*Denoising Autoencoder
*Layerwise output Visualization

Folder can the accessed from [here](https://github.com/CodeLogist/ML-NewBie-s-Heaven/tree/master/CNN)

#### 1.1 AutoEncoders

AutoEncoders were one of the famous image Compression algorithms. The model consists of an encoder CNN following with a decoder CNN. Folder can the accessed from [here](https://github.com/CodeLogist/ML-NewBie-s-Heaven/tree/master/CNN/Autoencoder)
